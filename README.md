# vine_ripper
Pull down all the vines you've liked, before its too late

## What it does
This python script will download all of the vines you (or anyone else) has ever liked. Its currently tuned to download profile names & pictures, descriptions, and thumbnails for all of the vines (what I want for a future project), but should be pretty easy to edit as you wish. 

### Instructions: 
1. Download vine_ripper.py to the directory where you want the data to be downloaded
2. Open your terminal and go to the directory where the script is
3. Run `python vine_ripper.py` and follow the instructions
